    <h3> Bernoulli's Equation</h3>
    <p>The Bernoulli equation states that,</p><br>
    <center><img src="imgs/Bernoulli_eqn_s.gif"></center>
    <p>where</p>

    <ul class="lista-pontos">
        <li>points 1 and 2 lie on a streamline,</li>
        <li>the fluid has constant density,</li>
        <li>the flow is steady, and</li>
        <li>there is no friction.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Although these restrictions sound severe, the Bernoulli equation is very useful, partly because it is very simple to use and partly because it can give great insight 
        into the balance between pressure, velocity and elevation.</p>

    <p>How useful is Bernoulli's equation? How restrictive are the assumptions governing its use? Here we give some examples.</p>

    <h4>Pressure/velocity variation</h4>

    <p>Consider the steady, flow of a constant density fluid in a converging duct, without losses due to friction (figure 14). The flow therefore satisfies all the 
        restrictions governing the use of Bernoulli's equation. 
        Upstream and downstream of the contraction we make the one-dimensional assumption that the velocity is constant over the inlet and outlet areas and parallel.</p>

    </div>

    <p>When streamlines are parallel the pressure is constant across them, except for hydrostatic head differences (if the pressure was higher in the middle of the duct, 
        for example, we would expect the streamlines to diverge, and vice versa). If we ignore gravity, then the pressures over the inlet and outlet areas are constant. 
        Along a streamline on the centerline, the Bernoulli equation and the one-dimensional continuity equation give, respectively,</p>
        <center><img src="imgs/area_velocity_s.gif"></center>
    <p>These two observations provide an intuitive guide for analyzing fluid flows, even when the flow is not one-dimensional. For example, when fluid passes over a solid body,
         the streamlines get closer together, the flow velocity increases, and the pressure decreases. Airfoils are designed so that the flow over the top surface is faster than 
         over the bottom surface, and therefore the average pressure over the top surface is less than the average pressure over the bottom surface, and a resultant force due to
          this pressure difference is produced. This is the source of lift on an airfoil. Lift is defined as the force acting on an airfoil due to its motion, in a direction normal 
          to the direction of motion. Likewise, drag on an airfoil is defined as the force acting on an airfoil due to its motion, along the direction of motion.
    </p>

    <h3>Stagnation pressure and dynamic pressure</h3>
    <p>Bernoulli's equation leads to some interesting conclusions regarding the variation of pressure along a streamline. Consider a steady flow impinging 
        on a perpendicular plate (figure 16).</p>

        <div class="alinhamento-lado">
            <img src="imgs/perpendicular_plate.gif">
            <p>Figure 16. Stagnation point flow.</p>
        </div>

    <p>There is one streamline that divides the flow in half: above this streamline all the flow goes over the plate, and below this streamline all the flow goes under the plate. 
        Along this dividing streamline, the fluid moves towards the plate. Since the flow cannot pass through the plate, the fluid must come to rest at the point where it meets 
        the plate. In other words, it ``stagnates.'' The fluid along the dividing, or ``stagnation streamline'' slows down and eventually comes to rest without deflection at the 
        stagnation point.</p>
    
    <p>Bernoulli's equation along the stagnation streamline gives</p>

    <center><img src="imgs/Bernoulli_stagnation_s.gif"></center>

    <p>where the point e is far upstream and point 0 is at the stagnation point. Since the velocity at the stagnation point is zero,</p>
    <center><img src="imgs/stagnation_pressure_s.gif"></center>

    <p>The stagnation or total pressure, p_0, is the pressure measured at the point where the fluid comes to rest. It is the highest pressure found anywhere in the flowfield, and it 
        occurs at the stagnation point. It is the sum of the static pressure (p_0), and the dynamic pressure measured far upstream. 
        It is called the dynamic pressure because it arises from the motion of the fluid.</p>
    <p>The dynamic pressure is not really a pressure at all: it is simply a convenient name for the quantity (half the density times the velocity squared), which represents the 
        decrease in the pressure due to the velocity of the fluid.</p>
    <p>We can also express the pressure anywhere in the flow in the form of a non-dimensional pressure coefficient C_p, where</p>
    <center><img src="imgs/C_p_s.gif"></center>

    <p>At the stagnation point C_p = 1, which is its maximum value. In the freestream, far from the plate, C_p = 0.</p>

    <h3>Pitot tube</h3>
    <p>One of the most immediate applications of Bernoulli's equation is in the measurement of velocity with a Pitot-tube. The Pitot tube (named after the French 
        scientist Pitot) is one of the simplest and most useful instruments ever devised. It simply consists of a tube bent at right angles (figure 17).</p>

        <div class="alinhamento-lado">
            <img src="imgs/Pitot_tube.gif">
            <p>Figure 17. Pitot tube in a wind tunnel.</p>
        </div>

        <p>By pointing the tube directly upstream into the flow and measuring the difference between the pressure sensed by the Pitot tube and the pressure of the surrounding air flow, 
            it can give a very accurate measure of the velocity. In fact, it is probably the most accurate method available for measuring flow velocity on a routine basis, and accuracies 
            better than 1% are easily possible. Bernoulli's equation along the streamline that begins far upstream of the tube and comes to rest in the mouth of the Pitot tube shows the 
            Pitot tube measures the stagnation pressure in the flow. Therefore, to find the velocity V_e, we need to know the density of air, and the pressure difference (p_0 - p_e). 
            The density can be found from standard tables if the temperature and the pressure are known. The pressure difference is usually found indirectly by using a ``static pressure 
            tapping'' located on the wall of the wind tunnel, or on the surface of the model.</p>
